## Variable

Prvate
Private variables are accessible only the class that variable exists.
Only the methods in that class know that the variable exists.
This is called encaptulating the data within the class. 
In general u can define methods as public that will allow to access the private varibles in controlled manner. That allow other classes to access the data.


## Primitive variables
- Boolean, byte, char, short, int, long, float, double.
- Variable holds one value of given type
- Boolean instance variables, initialized to false.
- Other primitive instance variables initialized to 0.
- Do  not have methods

## Reference Types
- Any non-primitive type is a reference type
- Variable referes to objets that may contain many instance variables.
- Default instance varible value is null- reference to nothing
- Reference required to call an object's methods

## Constructor
- Constructor doesnt have a retun type.
- Name of the constructor is should be same as the class name.
